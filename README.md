# Real-Time-Disaster-Prediction
This project demonstrates how to create an automated Weather Emergency Response System using LangGraph and LangSmith. The system monitors weather conditions, analyzes potential disasters, and generates emergency response plans. It integrates real-time weather data with generative AI for disaster analysis and response generation.
